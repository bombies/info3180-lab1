        <p>
            I am a full stack developer from Jamaica ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡². For front-end
            development I mainly specialize in ReactJS, more specifically
            Next.js. I have made several projects with this framework, each with
            different goals. In terms of back-end development, I'm able to build
            applications in JavaScript/TypeScript using Express.js or any
            frameworks that use Express such as NestJS. I am also able to build
            RESTful applications using Java Spring, Ktor, or FastAPI (Python).
