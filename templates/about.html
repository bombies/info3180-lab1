                I am a full stack developer from Jamaica ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡². For front-end
                development I mainly specialize in ReactJS, more specifically
                Next.js. I have made several projects with this framework, each
                with different goals. In terms of back-end development, I'm able
                to build applications in JavaScript/TypeScript using Express.js
                or any frameworks that use Express such as NestJS. I am also
                able to build RESTful applications using Java Spring, Ktor, or
                FastAPI (Python).
